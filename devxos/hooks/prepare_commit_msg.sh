# DevXOS AI Attribution Hook (prepare-commit-msg)
#
# Detects AI agent environment variables and appends a Co-Authored-By
# tag to the commit message BEFORE the commit is created.
#
# This is safer than post-commit + amend because:
# - No history rewriting (commit is born with the correct message)
# - No hash changes after creation
# - No GPG signature invalidation
# - No double CI triggers
# - If this hook fails, the commit proceeds without the tag (exit 0)
#
# Installed via: devxos hook install
# Docs: https://github.com/sunnysystems/devxos

# Arguments from git:
#   $1 = path to the commit message file
#   $2 = source of the message (message, template, merge, squash, commit)
#   $3 = commit hash (only for amend)
COMMIT_MSG_FILE="$1"

# Skip on merge, squash, and amend — these already have their messages
