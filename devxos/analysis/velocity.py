"""Velocity analysis — measure delivery speed and correlate with durability.

Divides the analysis period into time windows and computes velocity
(commits/week, lines/week) for each. Optionally correlates velocity
with stabilization to answer: "are we going faster without breaking?"

Design choices:
- Window size defaults to 14 days (2 weeks) to smooth daily noise.
- Trend detection uses first-half vs second-half comparison (no scipy).
- Correlation uses directional agreement between velocity and stabilization trends.
- Minimum 20 commits required for meaningful velocity analysis.
