## Key Findings

- Stabilization ratio is 39% — 61% of modified files were changed again within the churn window. This may indicate significant corrective effort. This may reflect domain complexity, evolving requirements, or subsystems under active development.
- Revert rate is 0.6% (1 of 161 commits), within a healthy range.
- 105 files showed churn (61% of files touched), affecting 21,752 lines. High churn may indicate that changes are not stabilizing. This may reflect iterative development, evolving requirements, or areas of the system under active learning.
- 161 commits analyzed across 171 unique files.
- Feature commits dominate at 57%, suggesting the primary engineering activity is new capability development. This may indicate an expansion phase or investment in new capabilities.
- Fix-related changes show 10 churn events, comparable to feature churn (65 events).
- Stabilization varies by intent: Unknown at 100% vs Fix at 52%. Different change types naturally stabilize at different rates depending on domain complexity and feedback loops.
- 34 PRs merged in this period with a median time to merge of 36.8 hours.
- 94% of PRs were merged without any change requests (single-pass rate), suggesting efficient review cycles.
- PR merge time increased by 63h recently. This may reflect larger PRs, more thorough review, or integration complexity.
- Config share shifted by 5pp (down) in the recent window. This indicates a change in the dominant type of engineering activity.

## Metric Details

### Revert Rate: 0.6%

1 of 161 commits in this period were identified as reverts (commits that undo previous work). Revert rate is a proxy for instability — it measures how often changes need to be completely rolled back. Detection is based on commit message patterns and may not capture all manual reverts.

### Churn Events: 105

A churn event occurs when a file is modified multiple times within the churn window. 105 files were repeatedly modified, involving 21,752 total lines changed. High churn can indicate corrective effort — code being fixed or rewritten shortly after initial delivery.

### Stabilization Ratio: 38.6%

66 of 171 files were not modified again within the churn window after their last change. This is the core signal/noise indicator: a high ratio means changes persist (delivery signal), a low ratio means changes are frequently rewritten (engineering noise).

### Engineering Behavior: 161 commits

Commits were classified by intent: 91 Feature, 24 Fix, 10 Refactor, 33 Config, 3 Unknown. This breakdown reveals the dominant type of engineering activity — whether the team is building, fixing, or restructuring.

### Stability by Intent: 

Stabilization ratio per change type: Feature 58%, Fix 52%, Refactor 62%. Comparing stability across intents reveals which types of changes produce durable outcomes and which require further iteration.

### Median Time to Merge: 36.8h

The median pull request took 36.8 hours from open to merge, across 34 merged PRs. This measures the feedback loop speed — shorter times may indicate smoother review cycles or smaller PRs.

### Single-Pass Rate: 94%

94% of PRs were merged without any CHANGES_REQUESTED review. The median PR went through 0.0 review rounds. A high single-pass rate may indicate that code is well-prepared before review, potentially aided by AI-assisted development.

## Code Review Acceptance Rate

> Measures how commits survive the code review process, segmented by origin and AI tool.

| Origin | Commits | In PRs | PR Rate | Single-Pass | Review Rounds |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Human | 161 | 0 | 0% | 0% | 0.0 |

## PR Lifecycle

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| PRs merged | 34 |
| Median time to merge (hours) | 36.8 |
| Median PR size (files) | 13 |
| Median PR size (lines) | 679 |
| Median review rounds | 0.0 |

## Delivery Velocity

> Commit velocity: 16.1 commits/week, 2698.9 lines/week.
> Velocity trend: accelerating (+132% over period).
> Velocity-durability correlation: negative — faster delivery is associated with less stable code.

| Window | Commits/wk | Stabilization | Churn |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01/16 | 4.0 | 67% | 33% |
| 01/30 | 14.0 | 45% | 55% |
| 02/13 | 9.0 | 54% | 46% |
| 02/27 | 31.5 | 75% | 25% |
| 03/13 | 22.0 | 100% | 0% |

*Correlation does not imply causation. External factors may independently affect both velocity and stability.*
