"""Churn calculation — detects files modified repeatedly within a short window.

Definition of "churn event":
  A file is considered churning if it was modified in 2 or more commits
  within the churn window (--churn-days). This is a proxy for corrective
  effort — files that need repeated changes may indicate unstable or
  incorrect initial implementations.

Assumption:
  Churn is measured using a sliding window approach. For each file, we look
  at the dates of all commits that touch it and count whether any pair of
  modifications falls within the churn window.

  v0 uses a simpler approach: group all file modifications within the
  analysis period, and flag files touched >= 2 times where the time
  between first and last touch is <= churn_days.
