"""Adoption timeline detector — find when AI-assisted development began.

Detects the inflection point where AI-assisted commits started appearing
in a repository and splits commits into pre/post-adoption periods.

Heuristics:
- First AI_ASSISTED commit = adoption ramp start
- First 30-day window with 3+ AI commits = adoption ramp end (established)
- < 5 total AI commits = insufficient confidence
- 5+ AI commits but no 30-day window with 3+ = sparse confidence

The detector reuses origin_classifier for commit attribution.
