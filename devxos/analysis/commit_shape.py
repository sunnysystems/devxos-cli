"""Commit shape analysis — structural profile of changes by origin.

Quantifies the "shape" of commits: how many files, how many lines per file,
how spread across directories. Compares profiles by origin to reveal
structural differences between human and AI-generated code.

Shape classification:
- Focused: few files, many lines/file (deep change in specific area)
- Spread: many files, few lines/file (wide & shallow — typical AI scaffolding)
- Bulk: many files, many lines/file (large refactor or feature)
- Surgical: few files, few lines (point fix, config change)

Thresholds use median values across all commits as the dividing line.
