"""Moved code detection — identify refactoring via cross-file code movement.

Detects when lines deleted from one file appear as additions in another
file within the same commit, indicating code movement (refactoring).
This is a positive quality signal — GitClear's 2025 research found moved
code dropped from 24% to 9.5% of operations since AI tools proliferated.

Key metrics:
- moved_code_pct: % of changed lines that were moved between files
- refactoring_ratio: moved / (moved + duplicated) — health index
- All segmented by origin (HUMAN, AI_ASSISTED)
