"""Operation classifier — classify the operation mix of commits.

Provides a lightweight version of GitClear's 7-operation taxonomy,
classifying each commit's changes into: added, deleted, moved,
duplicated, and updated lines.

This combines diff content analysis with results from the duplicate
detector and move detector to build a complete picture of how code
changes are distributed across operation types.

Key metrics:
- operation_distribution: % breakdown by operation type
- dominant_operation: most common operation type
- All segmented by origin (HUMAN, AI_ASSISTED)
