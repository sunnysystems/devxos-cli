"""PR lifecycle analysis — computes delivery metrics from pull request data.

Metrics produced:
- pr_merged_count: Total PRs merged in the window
- pr_median_time_to_merge_hours: Median hours from open to merge
- pr_median_size_files: Median changed files per PR
- pr_median_size_lines: Median total lines (additions + deletions) per PR
- pr_review_rounds_median: Median CHANGES_REQUESTED count per PR
- pr_single_pass_rate: Fraction of PRs merged without any CHANGES_REQUESTED

These metrics help measure how AI tooling affects the PR review cycle.
Thresholds are NOT defined here — this module only computes values.
