"""Activity timeline — weekly breakdown of commits, LOC, intent, origin, and quality.

Generates a week-by-week timeline of repository activity and detects
temporal patterns that explain why metrics changed.

Patterns detected:
- burst_then_fix: high-volume week followed by fix-dominant week
- quiet_period: week with <25% of average commit volume
- ai_ramp: AI share jumps >15pp between consecutive weeks
- intent_shift: any intent changes >20pp between consecutive weeks

Design decisions:
- ISO weeks (Monday-Sunday) for consistent grouping
- Minimum 3 commits per week to compute ratios (avoids distortion)
- Stabilization per week uses commits from that week only
- Churn detection crosses week boundaries (uses full churn window)
- Minimum 4 weeks of data for pattern detection
