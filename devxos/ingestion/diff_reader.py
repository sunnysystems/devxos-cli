"""Diff reader — parse actual line content from git show for code quality analysis.

Provides the raw diff data needed by duplicate detection, move detection,
and operation classification. Each commit's diff is parsed into per-file
added and removed line content.

Performance:
- Caps at MAX_COMMITS_TO_DIFF commits (most recent non-merge first)
- Caps at MAX_FILES_PER_COMMIT files per commit
- Each git show call has a timeout
- Uses --unified=0 to minimize output (only changed lines, no context)
