"""Code durability — measure how long lines survive before rewrite, by origin.

Uses git blame on files modified during the analysis window to attribute
surviving lines to their introducing commits, then cross-references with
origin classification to compare AI vs Human line survival.

Key metrics:
- Survival rate: % of introduced lines that still exist at HEAD
- Median line age: how old are the surviving lines (days)
- Both segmented by origin (HUMAN, AI_ASSISTED)

Performance:
- Only blames files modified by 2+ commits (churning files are interesting)
- Caps at MAX_FILES_TO_BLAME to keep runtime bounded
- Each blame call has a timeout
