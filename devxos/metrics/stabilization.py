"""Stabilization ratio — measures delivery durability.

A file is "stabilized" if, after its last modification within the analysis
window, it was NOT modified again within the churn window (churn_days).

This is the core signal/noise proxy in DevXOS:
  - High stabilization ratio (~1.0) → changes persist → delivery signal
  - Low stabilization ratio (~0.0) → changes rewritten → engineering noise

Assumption:
  We define stabilization relative to the analysis window. A file's last
  modification date is compared against subsequent modifications. If no
  subsequent modification occurs within churn_days of the last touch,
  the file is considered stabilized.

  For files touched near the end of the analysis window, we may not have
  enough data to confirm stabilization. v0 accepts this limitation.
