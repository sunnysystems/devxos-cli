"""Origin funnel — track code from commit through review to survival, by origin.

Composes existing metrics (origin distribution, acceptance rate, stabilization,
durability) into a per-origin delivery funnel:

  Committed → In PR → Stabilized → Lines Surviving

Each stage has a conversion rate. Comparing funnels across origins reveals
where AI-assisted code drops off relative to human code.

Limitation: PR→Merge stage is not measured (DevXOS only fetches merged PRs).
Future work could add closed/rejected PR data to fill this gap.
