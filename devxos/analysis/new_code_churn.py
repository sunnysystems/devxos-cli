"""New code churn rate — how quickly newly added code needs revision.

Measures the percentage of files receiving new code that are subsequently
modified within 2-week and 4-week windows. This is a file-level
approximation of GitClear's line-level new-code churn metric.

GitClear's 2025 research found a 20-25% increase in the rate of new
lines that get revised within a month, comparing 2024 to the pre-AI
2021 baseline.

Key metrics:
- new_code_churn_rate_2w: % of new-code files re-modified within 14 days
- new_code_churn_rate_4w: % of new-code files re-modified within 28 days
- Both segmented by origin (HUMAN, AI_ASSISTED)

Attribution: origin goes to the **introducing** commit, answering
"does AI-authored code need more rework?"
